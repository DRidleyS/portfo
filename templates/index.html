								<h2 class="major">Me</h2>

								<p>My name is Dorian Ridley-Smith and I am a 21 year old technician, aspiring programmer, and game developer trying to carve out a life for myself in California, USA </p>
								<p>I live in Lake county California, a small county in northern California home to more than 30 famous wineries and endless breathtaking natural beauty and large expanses interlaced with lively tight roads that make for endless enjoyment behind the wheel.</p>
								<p>For many years I cursed at wires, problem solving was always the name of the game as a technician. I grew tenacious, I found joy in the struggle.</p>

								<p>^thats a blown up disconnect. Below you can see also a partially vaporized breaker.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="static/images/blownupbreaker.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Ill always love the thrill of building things in the physical world, and I'm never gonna stop!</p>

								<p>But after dabbling in Andrei Neagoie's "Python - Zero To Mastery" course for just a day, I was hooked. The same day I told my little brother Zach that I was going to learn this new skill, and from that point on we buried our heads in the coursework to no end. Since then I have begun projects I only ever dreamed of, built my own website, started other courses, and started development on my first VR game in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot, an open source community-built game engine with built in XR capability and scripting with their own Python-esque scripting language GDscript.</a>  I am endlessly thankful to Andrei and his team for making such an incredible learning experience, and I commend Andrei for being such a skilled teacher.</p>

								<p class="intro_header">Dorian's Journey:</p>
								<br>
								Hey there, I'm Dorian—a California guy with English roots. Grew up messing around with electronics, thanks to my dad. He put me on to 3D printing as a hobby at an early age, I built a PrinterBot simple metal with him we affectionately called "peanut butter" thanks to the PB (printerbot) printed starkly on the side. So naturally it wasnt too much of a stretch  when I started off my journey as an electrician, and I'd say got the hang of it pretty well in a short time. <br>
								<br>
								Lately, though, I've switched gears. Now, I'm diving into Python programming, JavaScript, Game design with Godot (especially for XR) and general web development. I started learning how to program with ZTM, and I'm really enjoying the challenge it brings. <br>
								<br>
								Outside of the tech world, I'm all about street cars. Love building them and driving them at the limit. There's just something about the visceral feeling of a machine built for speed that is euphoric to me. It even made me stop playing video games, my other biggest hobby at the time when I got in my first car. In some sort of poetic way it was simulated racing that brought me back into video games, but this time with my eyes opened to the possibility of simulations in virtual reality.  <br>
								<br>
								As for the future, I'm always trying to improve my skills as a developer and technician, I'll keep working at it until I have too many cars and not enough time to drive them! <br>
								<br>
								Life's a mix of coding puzzles and the grease on my hands from the garage. I'm rolling with it, guided by the idea of a job I enjoy and a garage full of awesome cars.</p>

								<p>We offer AirKrete insulation! AirKrete is an innovative building material that combines cement, water, and a foaming agent to create a lightweight, fireproof, and insulating material. It's known for its exceptional thermal insulation properties (R6 per inch), making it ideal for energy-efficient construction. AirCrete is also highly versatile and can be molded into various shapes, allowing for creative architectural designs. Its light weight makes it easy to handle and transport, reducing construction costs and labor efforts. Additionally, AirCrete is environmentally friendly, as it requires less cement than traditional concrete and can incorporate recycled materials. This makes it a popular choice for sustainable building projects, offering both economic and ecological benefits.</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="coding">
								<h2 class="major">Coding</h2>
							<p>I currently hold a Certificate of completion of the "Complete Python Developer in 2024: Zero to Mastery" course offered by Andrei Neagoie through his accredited school ZTM.</p><br>
								<p>I am currently developing an online storefront with <a href="nextjs.org">Next.js</a> by <a href="vercel.com">Vercel</a>. Next.js is an exciting and powerful framework for react, one of the most widely used open source JavaScript libraries for developing interactive and widely compatible user interfaces on the web. </p>
								<p>Im currently actively working on my first VR title using <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> and GDscript.</p><br>
								<p>I have 3D design experience in cad environments like Fusion360 designing models to be 3d printed in my home mini factory producing car parts, replacement parts, and unique original designs.</p><br>
								<p>As a tradesman I have worked with some of the best teams of creative people. I have worked with electrical crews (<a href="https://www.buildzoom.com/contractor/duncan-electric-lakeport-ca">Duncan Electric</a>), worked with colleagues on the manufacturing floor (<a href="https://www.iddeas.com/">IDD</a>, <a href="https://www.rti2000.com/">RTI</a>), and I have had the privilidge of being a part of several wonderful service teams (<a href="https://www.rti2000.com/">RTI</a>, <a href="https://www.acompressorservice.com/">A1 Compressor service</a>, <a href="https://harmonyairconstruction.com/">Harmony Air</a>). Building and creating things with smart people is my favourite part of every day, and I am thankful every day for the many teachers along the way. </p>


								<span class="image main"><img src="static/images/diploma.png" alt="" /></span>
								<br>
								<p>This was a very well constructed course which proved to be both engaging and instructive. It comprehensively covered essential tools, techniques, and best practices crucial for establishing a foundation as a professional developer. The curriculum spanned from fundamental concepts delineating the structure of the Python language to the cultivation of skills and habits essential for effective problem-solving. Consequently, I acquired the proficiency required to adeptly identify and employ needed libraries and modules for diverse projects.  </p> <br>

								<p>Above all the most important skill Andrei teaches is the ability to find and read official documentation. Simply reading documentation has singlehandedly been the most game changing step for me in coding, debugging, and problem solving in general. Andrei calls it the experts "dirty little secret".</p>

								<p>one of my favourite projects in the Complete Python Developer course is this password checker similar to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target=”_blank” attribute>haveibeenpwned.com</a> </p>
								<br>

								<span class="image main"><img src="static/images/passpic.png" alt="" /></span>
								<br>
								<p>This was a very small project but I thought it was fantastic at demonstrating the importance of security, especially when dealing with sensitive information like passwords.</p>
								<br>
								<p>This very portfolio website, although trivial, was an amazing learning experience for me. What you might not see on the surface is my own custom <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">Flask app</a> written in Python 3, and the many updates it took to get here... each update is a new lesson on version control, HTML5, CSS3, terminal commands, problem solving and so much more. Feel free to inspect my site and tell me how I did!</p>
								<br><span class="image main"><img src="static/images/routes.png" alt="" /></span>
								<br><p>Above is the secret route, and the simple logic that allows me to have a secret route.</p>
								<br><span class="image main"><img src="static/images/csvhandling.png" alt="" /></span>
								<br><span class="image main"><img src="static/images/messagehandling.png" alt="" /></span>
								 <p>I am also currently enrolled in "Complete Web Developer in 2024: Zero to Mastery" and Andrei's web security course, amongst a few more that will be included here upon completion. </p> <br>
