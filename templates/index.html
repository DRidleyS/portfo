  <p>At <strong>DS Auto Care</strong>, it’s all about attention to detail, precision, and convenience. Whether we’re restoring the perfect finish on your paint or knocking out a brake job in your driveway, we bring top-tier service to your garage—or curb.</p>

<h3>Detailing Services</h3>
<p><strong>Showroom perfection, built to last—and maintained wherever you are.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">
  <img src="static/images/silverstang.jpg" alt="DS Auto Care detailing in progress" width="300" height="auto">
</div>

<p>We don’t just wash cars—we restore and protect them. Every detail starts with our proven multi-stage wash procedure designed to lift contaminants, preserve your finish, and prep for long-term protection:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Snow foam pre-soak</strong> to loosen grime and lubricate the surface</li>
  <li><strong>High-pressure rinse</strong> to flush away debris and light contaminants</li>
  <li><strong>Rinseless wash</strong> for safe, scratch-free contact cleaning</li>
  <li><strong>Optional Clay bar + iron remover</strong> to fully decontaminate paint and wheels</li>
  <li><strong>Hand dry + sealant application</strong> for instant protection and gloss</li>
</ul>

<p>From there, you choose your level of interior care:</p>

<h4>🧼 Speed Clean</h4>
<p><em>Quick refresh for coated surfaces (we even coat carpet) or low-dirt interiors.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wipe-down of all surfaces</li>
  <li>Vacuum of seats and carpets</li>
</ul>

<h4>🛠️ Regular Detail</h4>
<p><em>Our most popular package—perfect for monthly or bi-weekly maintenance.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Vacuum + compressed air blowout</li>
  <li>Deep clean gun for crevices and vents</li>
  <li>Full interior decontamination</li>
</ul>

<h4>🔧 Factory Reset</h4>
<p><em>The full overhaul—ideal for neglected vehicles or pre-sale prep.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Steam extraction and stain removal</li>
  <li>Interior revitalization and conditioning</li>
  <li>Replacement or repair of broken trim, clips, or panels</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Want to keep your car flawless year-round?</strong> The smartest move is to coat it once—and maintain it regularly. Our <strong>System X ceramic coatings</strong> for paint, wheels, glass, trim, and every interior surface make all future details faster, cheaper, and more effective. Coated vehicles stay cleaner longer, resist damage, and qualify for <strong>up to 50% off maintenance packages</strong> when booked weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you want your car to look incredible every day—not just after a detail; Coating + maintenance is the way. Let us build a custom care plan that fits your lifestyle, protects your investment, and keeps your ride turning heads for years to come.</p>

  <h3>Paint Correction</h3>
  <p>Scratches, swirls, and oxidation don't just dull your paint—they hide its potential. Here is a before and after, no joke.</p>
  <div class="image-container">
  <img src="static/images/paintcorrection.webp" alt="Before & After PC" width="300" height="rel">
</div>
  <p>Our <strong>multi-stage paint correction</strong> process safely removes imperfections from your vehicle’s clear coat, restoring a deep, mirror-like shine. We use professional-grade compounds, pads, and techniques tailored to your car’s paint system.</p>
  <p><strong>The result?</strong> A flawless finish that reflects more than just light—it reflects your pride.</p>
  <p><strong>Perfect for:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily drivers showing wear</li>
    <li>Track cars with paint fatigue</li>
    <li>Collectibles that deserve to turn heads</li>
  </ul>

<h3>System X Ceramic Coating</h3>
<p><strong>Showroom perfection that lasts a lifetime—right at your doorstep.</strong></p>
<div class="image-container">
  <img src="static/images/editedstang.jpg" alt="System-X-Shine" width="300" height="rel">
</div>
<p>Our <strong>System X Max G</strong> ceramic coating isn’t just protective—it’s elite. With a <strong>9H hardness rating</strong>, it resists physical damage like a champ. Unless someone hits your car with a diamond or ceramic shard, this coating won’t scratch. That means no more worries about dog nails, keys, or road debris scuffing your finish.</p>

<p>System X bonds directly to your vehicle’s paint to form a hydrophobic, ultra-durable shield that makes cleaning effortless and keeps your car looking flawless, year after year.</p>

<p><strong>What You’ll Experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>9H hardness protection—resists scratches from anything softer than diamonds or ceramics</li>
  <li>Extreme hydrophobic performance for quick, easy cleaning</li>
  <li>UV, chemical, and environmental resistance</li>
  <li>Factory-depth gloss and rich color enhancement</li>
  <li>Lifetime durability backed by Carfax-registered protection</li>
</ul>

<p>We apply <strong>System X Max G</strong> to <strong>paint</strong>, <strong>wheels</strong>, <strong>glass</strong>, and <strong>trim</strong>—and we do it all under our climate-controlled mobile detailing tent at your home.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Got minor paint chips from rocks or road wear? We offer <em>spot correction</em> services to repair damage and seal it permanently beneath the coating.</p>
